# ID Maps
This is a temporary repo to just show my personal progress in the building of the main FPL ID map repository, which can be found here - https://github.com/pratos/fpl-mappers .
There is nothing there yet, but we should hope to be adding things there soon.

I will update this when that repo is more useful.


# TODO
- Manually finish FBref column
- Add player names (as shown on website) to all current sources
- Use https://github.com/theFPLkiwi/theFPLkiwi/blob/main/Kiwi%20dictionary.csv to add FFScout names
